# modifiedmk

The package is useful in implementing Non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend tests and Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient tests.

The package contains the following varians of Trend-Tests

- Mann-Kendall trend test (MK)

- Mann-Kendall trend test for Pre-Whitened series (PW-MK)

- Mann-Kendall trend test for Bias-Corrected Pre-Whitened series (BCPW-MK)

- Mann-Kendall trend test for Trend-Free Pre-Whitened series (TFPW-MK)

- Block Bootstrapping with Mann-Kendall test (BBSMK)

- Modified Mann-Kendall trend using Variance Correction Approach by Hamed and Rao (1998)

- Modified Mann-Kendall trend using Variance Correction Approach by Hamed and Rao (1998) considering significant lags upto lag-3

- Modified Mann-Kendall trend using Variance Correction Approach suggested by Yue and Wang (2004)

- Modified Mann-Kendall trend using Variance Correction Approach suggested by Yue and Wang (2004) considering only lag-1 auto correlation coefficient

- Spearman's Rank Correlation test

- Block Bootstrapping with Spearman's Rank Correlation test (BBSSR)

- Trend magnitude is calculated by Sen's slope method
